# AlgoGame
This android app is aimed to help understand various data structures and algorithms.
The 3 three games we have should help visualize how each of this structures work and hopefully inspire people to reseach them and apply it in their lives

## HOMESCREEN

## STACK GAME

## QUEUE GAME

## SORT GAME
   - Once the button for the game is pressed, a tutorial screen should appear.
   - After reading it tap start to begin the game.
   - A random layout will be displayed each representing 3 sorting algorithms follow the instructions on screen once again to play the game.
   - Based on the position of the number the appropriate toast message will pop up informing you of your choice 
   - When dragging the number please ensure that the drag shadow is in a position where the tile would be if it was part of the array, like in the question
   - The tile will only move if in the drop point of which there are two for each sort:
   -     For insertion sort it is in the empty spot within the array and to the left of the array
   -     For the other sorts it is on the left and right side of the array.
   - Once complete you can return to the homescreen anytime using the standard android UI.


### Notes
1. We could not optimize the app to look nice on higher resolutions due to time constraints. Please use the default resolution
2. Sort game challenges: Due to time constraints the position of the dropped tile will be off a bit
